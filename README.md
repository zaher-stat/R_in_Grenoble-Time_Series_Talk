# R in Grenoble / Time Series Session

In this Session, we present the process of time series analysis, starting with the visualization of time series using different methods in **R**. 
Then, we discuss the processing of time series data and the notion of stationarity of a time series, to finally end with the modeling and forecasting part using **ARIMA** models.
